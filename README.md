# X-Plane HITL Plug-in

This plug-in for X-Plane enables 'Hardware-in-the-Loop' testing with an autopilot running ArduPilot with a custom firmware.

### Features

- [x] Send plane state as telemetry from sensors.
- [x] Calibrate a plane sensors just as it's done with a real plane model.
- [x] Use any feature from Mission Planner as if it was working with a real plane model.
- [ ] Simulate sensor accuracy errors and interruptions.

It has been tested on X-Plane 9 and X-Plane 11, both 32 and 64 bit versions are provided as binaries.

## Setup

### 1. Download

Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/qgerman2/xplane-HITL/releases) and install it in the ```resources/plugins``` folder of X-Plane.

### 2. Configure an autopilot

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/qgerman2/ardupilot-HITL/blob/HITL/README.md) to flash an autopilot with the custom firmware required for the plug-in to work.

### 3. Set up the required parameters on Mission Planner
